<p>Dear user, thank you so much for choosing to play snake. Here are some guidance for playing: 1)Press on the arrow keys to move your snake towards the food. 2) The length of your snake will increase by touching the food. 3) If the snake touches itself or the edge of the window the game is over. Refresh the page to play again.  </p>








<p>And that is it, enjoy your free time.</p>
